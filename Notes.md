# The Data Scientist's toolbox.
* Experimental design should be placed before the data gathering
* A confounder is a variable that affects two variables being studied so that the results do not affect the actual relationship
* Correlation is not causation. In many cases there's correlation between two variables and a third one that causes the correlation 
and is missed.
* Ways of controlling counfounder: randomization, restriction, stratification and matching
** Restriction and matching are methods that avoid confounding effects instead of eliminate it. They must be used on the experimental phase.
* Good experiments on predictive models have replication, allow you to measure variability, are generalized to the problem and transparent.
